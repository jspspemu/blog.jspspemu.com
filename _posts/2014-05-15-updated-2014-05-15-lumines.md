In a couple of days I have implemented most of the psp vfpu, still misses some functions and some of them require fixes. Also I have performed some general fixes.  
Today's version got Lumines ingame (without sound (no sasCore yet)) and some other games like Breath of Fire 3; others start showing something. Still slow as hell, and with lots of graphical glitches, but a good first step.  

I have created issues for the biggest+important parts of the emulator missing here to get most games working:Â [https://github.com/soywiz/jspspemu/issues](https://github.com/soywiz/jspspemu/issues)  

* vfpu (almost complete)
* module loading
* mpeg decoding
* kirk and encrypted prx decoding
* sasCore
